## 💡 Inspiration

Besides programming, I really enjoy drawing on digital. So I frequently go to [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to get color palettes inspiration and eventually this project idea popped into my head and I could combine business with pleasure. I practiced my skills and also appreciated the project creation because it's related to something I enjoy.
